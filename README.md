> #### ANNOUNCMENT (2021-FEBUARY-24th):
>
> ##### I previously released a version of this theme that was not ready. This is my first VSCode Marketplace publication, and Microsoft publication, therefore, I had to teach myself how to publish a theme. I didn't mean to publish the other version, but I left it the market place, which turned out to not be a good Idea. That version will be perminatly removed, and this is the version that will recieve future support. I am good about updateing my publications which, even with themes, is often neccassary.

## <span style="color: crimson; text-decoration: underline;">About Developer's Dojo: Seppuku</span>

'Developer's Dojo: Seppuku' has 'Seppuku' added to the end of it becuse it is part of a planned theme series, and Seppuku is the first 'Developer's Dojo' theme, of the 3 themes, to be publicly published. Seppuku is a fully developed theme, completley customized from my work. I didn't start with another theme, I did not use another theme as a template, nor as insperation, or as a guide. I have thouroughly went through all the json properties that make up a VSCode theme and styled them all, save a few, and most people will probably not even notice that the few yet to be styled, dont fit the seppuku color scheme, as they are currently taking on there defualt colors. I plan on updating DevDojo Themes regularly for the first couple years after the last theme is released. The hardest part of creating Developer's Dojo: Seppuku, was creating a new layout that looked good, and is good for development. Now that I now have the layout for the theme series created, which is the same layout used in Seppuku, I should be able to release Developer's Dojo: Awakening, the next theme to be realeased in the series, in the coming months. Awakening will be blue and green, or more precisley an Azure and Chartreuse version of Seppuku. Awakening is already in development.

My biggest concern when creating seppuku was that its red, and errors are often displayed using red in some form. So my solution to this was not to use any shade of red that used green as a secondary color to change the shade of red. This dictated that the theme be Crimson, not red, in color. If you see red that has an orange tinge, that is an error. Bellow I list the colors I used for Errors, Warning and Info.

I really hope you like the theme, and I always appreciate feedback. Let me know what you think, what you like, what you would do different, and what you would like to see come out in the futer Developer's Dojo themes.

## <span style="color: crimson">Settings to use with DojoJS</span>

The following setting changes are not required, they are just a suggestion on my behalf. When creating a theme for vscode certain features/items can be styled that are not activated by default, furthermore; when a theme is developed it is developed in the environment that the developer has set up. With that said, some settings will be advantageous to certain themes, and may not work/look so well with other themes. Bellow are certain VSCode settings that I feel will help you get the most out of DojoJS.

```
// Document: VSCode Settings
// Pathname: './.vscode/settings.json'

{
    "workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing": "normal" // Dont set to shrink

}

```
