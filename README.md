## <span style="color: crimson">Settings to use with DojoJS</span>

The following setting changes are not required, they are just a suggestion on my behalf. When creating a theme for vscode certain features/items can be styled that are not activated by default, furthermore; when a theme is developed it is developed in the environment that the developer has set up. With that said, some settings will be advantageous to certain themes, and may not work/look so well with other themes. Bellow are certain VSCode settings that I feel will help you get the most out of DojoJS.

```
// Document: VSCode Settings
// Pathname: './.vscode/settings.json'

{
    "workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing": "normal" // Dont set to shrink

}

```
